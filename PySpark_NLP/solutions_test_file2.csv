Pulled be right back to that game.Red Dead Redemption also shares a surprisingly wide set of features, from an art direction standpoint, the horse mechanics and auto-following of roads and NPCs, to wild-life and sidequests, and a hint of nagging domestic issues for the main character.Skyrim has just become this huge household name that gets thrown around in comparisons and criticisms. The legend of the game has clouded what it actually is. It's a game that nailed exploration unlike any other before it, but when broken down to its individual parts, is pretty lackluster and hasn't aged super well. While there's some great lessons to take from it, I don't think it should be used as a blueprint for all future open world type games, but you'll find almost any Youtube comment section would disagree with me there.",,,,,,,

Because lets be honest, lots of times things are printed, and the author didn't find all the details or know them. That would be a dangerous precedent. However what it really is about is this. Journalist puts forth a statement that is false about another personPublic call it out as false/is common knowledge as being false(not as great a defense)journalist links to a source they recognize as being reliable that their statement is truesource then explicitly replies in an official statement saying journalist is wrongAccused person and public again demand that the statement be amendedjournalist again refusesaccused services lawsuit against journalistseems pretty cut and dry to me honestly. If other people help you to understand that what you said was factually incorrect, then your responsibility as a journalist is to ammend what you said. Anything short of that is slander/liable whatever the one is for writing. After this point you clearly have a case that the journalist has an agenda to attempt to cause harm to the reputation of the accused, showing extreme bias against them. This was not some random joe on the street, this is a person whose responsibility is to tell the public about current events, and this is just stirring up hate against the accused for no good reason. How hard is it to say \whoops", I was fooled," I take it back sorry.\"" Not hard. Not hard at all", especially in the digital age. There is no excuse. I would hold any journalist to this standard, left, right or center.,,
You have the right to speak your opinion, but as a journalist in your official capacity, you leave that shit at the door. Let the public make up their minds. You don't lie for the sake of lying.

It's like a visual representation of when people pass the same ghost story around campfires over and over-- theyre never quite the same. FNAF, especially if you include all the theorists in the community piecing together evidence and telling and retelling the \real\"" story", reminds me of how urban legends are established. At the end of the day, there might not have even BEEN a serial murderer and haunted pizzeria attractions at all, it could have just been an old and stinky Chuck E Cheese ripoff that everybody thought was creepy and that's it. The point is, we found the clues in the first place-- in the first game-- and built the horror story OURSELVES. Each new installment of the games is like another person's interpretation of the community-built horror story; they all use the same basic mechanics, but the atmosphere and style of each game is so significantly separate from the last. We will most likely never get the True Story of Five Nights at Freddy's," because there IS no \""true story\"". And while that frustrates theorists like us"," it's pretty damn genius."""
